Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a scientific tool used to examine crystalline materials. The principle of EBSD is sketched in \cref{ebsd-principle}. It is based on electron diffraction: when a beam of electrons is emitted towards the specimen, some of the electrons backscatter. They are then reflected on phosphor screen which is coupled with compact lens that directs the captured image towards a camera. The result of this procedure is a grayscale image of the \emph{electron backscatter pattern} (EBSP). An example of EBSP is shown in \cref{roi-shifts:initial}.

The electrons do not reflect randomly, but based on the examined specimen, they backscatter in a specific way, forming \emph{Kukuchi lines} observable in the EBSP. The geometry of Kukuchi lines can be interpreted as a projection of the specimen crystal structure on the flat phosphor screen.

EBSD is commonly used with scanning electron microscopes (SEM). A SEM is a device that repeatedly emits an electron beam towards the specimen, scanning the surface in a raster pattern. That allows to create images of the surface of the sample with much greater magnification than light microscopes.

When used with EBSD, it creates the EBSPs in a raster scan pattern. It scans a part of the surface, measuring the crystalline structure of the specimen in many spots and saving the information as an EBSP. So the procedure results in thousands of images, one for each point in the raster. For example, test data that we used for this thesis contained over 15000 images taken from a 120x120 raster covering an area of the specimen surface approximately \SI{70}{\nano\meter}~x~\SI{70}{\nano\meter} big.

When the crystal structure of material is changed (e.g. under stress), the deformation can be observed in the EBSP too. Therefore, EBSPs of deformed specimen can be compared to undeformed ones to measure elastic strain and crystal lattice rotation.  \Cref{roi-shifts} shows a visualization of such comparison. Since different parts of the images may be deformed differently, a commonly used technique \cite{wilkinson2006high,wilkinson2010high,britton2012high} is to choose several (usually tens to hundreds) subregions of the EBSPs and determine the vector of shift between the corresponding regions from both patterns. The shifts estimate the real deformation of the crystalline structure.

	\label{roi-shifts}
\end{figure}

The comparison is done by cross--correlating respective subregions of the deformed and reference EBSPs. The position of the maximum value in the correlation result determines the most probable shift with one pixel precision, which is not enough. To achieve subpixel accuracy, we estimate the peak of the cross--correlation by interpolating from a small neighborhood of the maximum.

Once the shifts are computed, they are further processed to obtain an estimation of the actual crystal deformation and other characteristics. However, we do not address that part of the analysis in this thesis, as it is not nearly as computationally expensive as the cross--correlation of the EBSPs. Moreover, the comparison is commonly used in analysis of EBSPs, while the processing of the shifts may be different for various purposes.

In this chapter we describe the technique based on cross--correlation in detail.

\section{Cross--correlation}

Cross--correlation provides a measure of similarity of two series for each possible shift between them. It is used in signal processing to find a shorter known feature in a signal or in image processing to locate a smaller shape in a bigger picture. In analysis of EBSPs, it is used to find the most probable relative displacement between two images (subregions of images).

Cross--correlation of two discrete functions $f$ and $g$ is function $C$ defined as follows:
\[
C[n] = (f \star g)[n] = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}f[m]g[m+n],
\]
where $\star$ denotes cross--correlation.

If $C = f \star g$ then $C[n]$ is a number that tells us how much are functions $f$ and $g$ similar, when $g$ is shifted by $n$ to the left. For each negative $n$, $g$ is shifted to the right. \Cref{correlation-example} shows two example functions and their cross--correlation.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{img/correlation}
	\caption{The cross--correlation of two example functions. The image is taken from \cite{correlation_example}.}
	\label{correlation-example}
\end{figure}

Definition of cross--correlation can be extended for two dimensions. For two two--dimensional functions $f$ and $g$, their cross--correlation is defined as:
\[
C[i,j] = (f \star g)[i,j] = \sum_{x=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{y=-\infty}^{\infty}f[x,y]g[x+i,y+j].
\]

Analogously to one--dimensional cross--correlation, $(f \star g)[i,j]$ is a number that is higher if $f$ is similar to $g$ shifted by $i$ horizontally and by $j$ vertically. \Cref{2d-correlation-example} demonstrates how cross--correlation can be used to search for a smaller pattern in a bigger picture. The brightest points (maxima) in \cref{2d-correlation-example-result} correspond to the best matches between the pattern and the image.

	\caption{An example of cross--correlation used to find an object in an image. The maxima of the cross--correlation result correspond to the location of the search pattern (b) in the image (a).}
	\label{2d-correlation-example}
\end{figure}

Theoretically, the domain of cross--correlation is whole $\mathbb{Z}^2$. However, when cross--correlating two images, $(f \star g)[i,j]$ does not make sense for too big $i$ or $j$ because the images would be shifted so much they would not overlap. For two images with sizes $w_1 \times h_1$ and $w_2 \times h_2$, the size of their cross--correlation is $(w_1 + w_2 - 1) \times (h_1 + h_2 - 1)$. The result is a rectangle with the following corners: $[-w_1+1,-h_1+1]$, $[-w_1+1,h_2-1]$, $[w_2-1,h_2-1]$, $[w_2-1,-h_1+1]$. Those are the points of cross--correlation, where the result is computed from the images overlapping only by one pixel.

\subsection{Zero--normalized cross--correlation}

Cross--correlation as it is defined in the previous section has a major flaw for image processing: it is heavily affected by the brightness of the images. Consider an image, that has some subregions brighter than others. Then, by definition of cross--correlation, that subregions add more to the result, regardless of the second image. \Cref{normalized-initial} shows an example of an image that is much brighter in the top part then in the bottom. \Cref{normalized-simple-cross} shows the result of cross--correlation with the search pattern in \cref{normalized-pattern}. It is clear that the highest values are located where the original image is brightest instead of locating the search pattern.

	\end{subfigure}
	
	\caption{A comparison between the simple and zero--normalized cross--correlation. An image of EBSP (a) is correlated with its subregion (b). (c) shows that simple cross--correlation is affected by varying brightness in different parts of images. (d) shows that normalization of the images improve the cross--correlation results.}
\end{figure}

That is why zero--normalized cross--correlation is used. It is based on subtracting respective means from each image. Normalized cross--correlation of two images $f$ and $g$ is defined as follows:

\[
\textsc{ZNCC}[i,j] = \sum_{x=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{y=-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sigma_f \sigma_g}(f[x,y] - \mu_f)(g[x+i,y+j] - \mu_g),
\]  
where $\mu_f$ and $\mu_g$ are the means of the images and $\sigma_f$, $\sigma_g$ are their standard deviations. For an image f with size $W \times H$, they are defined like so:
\begin{align*}
\mu_f &= \frac{1}{WH} \sum_{x,y}{}f[x,y], \\
\sigma_f &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{WH-1} \sum_{x,y}(f[x,y]-\mu_f)^2}.
\end{align*}

\Cref{normalized-cross} shows the zero--normalized cross--correlation of the figures \ref{normalized-initial} and \ref{normalized-pattern}. The area of the highest correlation is now clearly visible and corresponds to a Kukuchi line in the original image. Subtracting the mean of both images makes the algorithm less prone to brightness changes across the image.



The intuition behind this behavior is as follows. By the definition of simple cross--correlation, pixels with low brightness multiply and result in low correlation. After subtracting the means, low values in both images become negative. However, two negative numbers multiply into a positive value, so they increase the correlation. On contrary, very bright and very dull pixels multiply into a negative number so their difference causes that they lower the overall correlation value.


\section{Algorithm description}

In the following section, we describe how is the zero--normalized cross--corre\-lation used to analyze the deformation of EBSPs.

As described in the beginning of this chapter, the algorithm we implement in this thesis takes deformed EBSPs and cross--correlates several regions of interest with a reference EBSP. A region of interest (ROI) is a rectangular part of an image defined by its size and position. The algorithm then finds the maximum of the cross--correlation, which yields the vector of deformation with pixel accuracy. Finally, it improves the accuracy by finding the maximum of a fitted quadratic function.

The algorithm takes the following input:
\begin{itemize}
	\item s reference EBSP image with size $W \times H$
	\item $N$ deformed EBSP images, each with size $W \times H$
	\item $M$ positions ROIs that will be compared from each image
	\item size $w \times h$ of each ROI
	\item size of neighbourhood $s \times s$ of the cross correlation maximum that will be used to fit the quadratic function
\end{itemize}
The result of the algorithm is a list of $M$ shifts for each of the $N$ deformed EBSPs (see \cref{roi-shifts:result} for visualization of the shifts for one EBSP).

Algorithm \ref{algo-whole} describes the whole process in pseudocode. It goes through all deformed EBSPs and all ROI positions specified in the input. It computes the zero--normalized cross--corre\-lation in three steps: find means of the ROIs, subtract them and compute cross--correlation. The result is an image (two--dimensional array) with size $(2w-1) \times (2h-1)$.
