\chapter{Algorithm}

Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a scientific tool used to examine crystalline materials. It is based on electron diffraction: when a beam of electrons is emitted towards the object of interest, some of the electrons backscatter.  They are then captured by a CCD chip, resulting in a grayscale raster image of the \emph{backscatter pattern}.
