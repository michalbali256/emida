\def\Abstract{%
Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is a common tool used by physicists to examine crystalline materials, which is based on taking pictures of material microstructure using electron microscope. To determine additional characteristics of studied specimen, a specific variant called High resolution EBSD has been proposed (and partially adopted). It takes several subregions of images taken by the EBSD camera and uses cross--correlation to measure deformation of obtained patterns. Usability of this method is limited by its relatively high computational complexity which makes it infeasible to analyze larger surface of specimen.
In this thesis, we describe the technique used to process the EBSD data in detail, analyze it and implement the most computationally demanding parts using the CUDA technology. Compared to a reference python implementation, we measured a speedup of 30--40-times when using double floating precision and up to 270-times speedup for single precision.
